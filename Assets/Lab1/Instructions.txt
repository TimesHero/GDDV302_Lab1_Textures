***INSTRUCTIONS FOR Fraser-AJ-Lab1***


Controls: Swap Texture Button
		- Changes the cubes texture (NPOT <-> POT)
		- Recomputes dimensions and resets sampling to halfwidth
		- Resets Y to 0 and restarts processing
	  
	  Random X Button
		- Chooses a random but valid X based on the current texture's width.
		- Sets it to the active column
		- Resets Y to 0 and restarts processing

***PLEASE NOTE***
Changing the NPOT and POT textures around in the originalTexture and altTexture spaces in the inspector might not actually change or update properly and I am unsure why at this point. The way it is currently set up seems to be working with buttons and such. Thank you for your understanding.
